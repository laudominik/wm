# XROAGWEM
Window manager written in Rust. Heavily inspired by DWM. The goal is to support all of the features from awesomewm I use on daily basis and switch to it:
* auto cascade tiling ✔
* fullscreen window ✔
* floating window ✔
* wallpaper ✔
* spawning some scripts with shell on startup ✔
* top bar
* mouse motions ✔
* multiple workspaces ✔
* keybindings ✔
* resetting the wm
* two screens support

See [config.rs](src/config.rs) for my wm configuration.
