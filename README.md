# XROAGWEM
Window manager written in Rust. Heavily inspired by DWM. The goal is to support all of the features from awesomewm I use on daily basis and switch to it:
* auto cascade tiling
* fullscreen window
* wallpaper
* spawning some scripts with shell on startup
* top bar

See [config.rs](src/config.rs) for my wm configuration.
